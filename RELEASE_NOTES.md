# Sift v0.2.1 — Release Notes

**Sift: SoundCloud, Tuned to You**

---

## Bug fixes

- **Player bar stays visible on logout**: If you log out of SoundCloud while music is playing, the player bar now stays so you can pause or stop playback. Previously it disappeared along with the controls.
- **Queue no longer scrollable behind overlays**: When the logged-out or no-SoundCloud-tab overlay is showing, the queue behind it no longer scrolls.
- **Hamburger menu stays top-right**: The menu icon is now pinned to the top-right corner of the controls bar instead of wrapping to a second row on narrow windows.
- **Credit line moved to hamburger menu**: The "Open source & built with love" text is now in the hamburger dropdown at smaller widths, keeping the controls bar to a single row.
